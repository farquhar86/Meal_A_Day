Great job! Check comments in each of your files for more detailed feedback. My initials `it:` mark my comments.

##Creativity

Excellent idea, very impressed how much you were able to pull of in a week!

##Planning

You set a few ambitious goals for yourself, but were able to put the pieces together to make something special. 

##Execution

Look through each of your fiddles for more detailed feedback, but really impressed to see a usable product that it is live and ready to use in a way that is already making a difference!

##Next Steps

* Consider using EJS partials to refactor the repetition in the views.
* Seed file does not create new data.
