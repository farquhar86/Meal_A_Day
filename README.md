Give a Meal:
We hear about world hunger all the time on the news and there are hundreds of organizations out there trying to solve this issue. But what about local hunger. Hundreds of people in our neighborhoods are hungry. These are people that have lived beside us for years, paid taxes, raised kids and are now down on their luck. Here at Give A Meal we want to help these people in our backyards by offering them a free meal for every $10 donated from a local restaurant. Together the goal is to give our neighbors another shot and maybe change their luck a little bit.

This is a school project and a first attempt to help someone in need. If you would like to be a part of the cause please feel free to reach out to me.
