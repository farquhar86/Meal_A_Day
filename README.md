Give a Meal:
We constantly hear about world hunger on the news and there are hundreds of organizations out there trying to solve this issue. But what can we do about local hunger? Hundreds of people in our own neighborhoods are hungry. These are people that have lived beside us for years, paid taxes, raised kids, and are now down on their luck. Here at Give A Meal we want to help these people in our backyards by giving them a free meal, from a local restaurant, for every $10 donated. Together, the goal is to give our neighbors some help and maybe change their luck a bit.

This is a school project and a first attempt to help someone in need. If you would like to be a part of the cause please feel free to reach out to me or you can go to www.GiveaMeal.today or www.ReceiveaMeal.today

To run this on your local host please git clone, and run npm install.
